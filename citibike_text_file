1) Downloaded data from 2019 through 2020 EOY with the idea that comparing the 2019 vs. 2020 might show some
interesting data given the pandemic's effect in New York adjacent Jersey City in 2020. 

2) Glob Python library was imported and a short program was used to concatenate files to avoid
repetitive merge/append statements.  Due to file size and the relevance of the time period to
the overarching question of how citi bikes were accessed througout the pandemic, every
10th row was appended to the merged file:
########################################################################################
import pandas as pd
import glob

path = r'C:\Users\Joe\Documents\Boot_Camp\Homework\tableau\citi_bike_analytics'
csv_files = glob.glob(path + '/*.csv')
df_list = []
full_df = pd.DataFrame()
for filename in csv_files:
    df = pd.read_csv(filename, index_col=None, header=0)
    full_df.append(df.iloc[::10])

full_df.to_csv('merged_file/merged_pandas.csv', index=False)

Dashboard 1: Usership Statistics 2020 vs. 2019.

1) Trips by Gender over Time Period
Number of Trips is a calculated field. Gender was included in a stacked line graph
to show the similar trends across gender though at different volumes. A clear valley in usership 
accross genders is shown in March, and the height of 2019 was not re-established in 2020.

2) Percentage Difference from Previous Year Trips
Percentage difference of trips in 2020 vs. 2019.

3) User Type by Year
This stacked bar chart shows total usership (again a 10% sample size) by type of customer.
The data shows a decrease in subscriptions and an increase of non subscribed customers. An assumption
would be the decrease in commuter patronage due to stay at home orders shifting more to as needed
usage.

Dashboard 2:
Maps

This shows both start stations and stop stations with the ability to toggle between 2019 and 2020
giving the ability to see the overall change in each point.  Since this only includes Jersey City 
start stations, there are also many stop stations in other areas such as Manhattan. There appear
to be much fewer stop locations in 2020 due to people perhaps staying in areas close to home during
the pandemic.


Dashboard 3:

Average Trip Duration by age 2019 vs. 2020

This shows the split of trip druation between age groups in 2019 and 2020 although there seems to be 
an anamoly withthe 80 year old age group in 2020.  Overall the trip duration seemed to increase 
in 2020.  This is most likely due to the limiting of people packing into crowded subway cars 
due to the pandemic.

User Type by Age and Year

The number of subscribers in the 25-45 age group was strongest in 2019, and remained so though
diminishing in 2020.  The 50 year old bin strangely doubled in 2020 for customers.  This is unclear
why just that age group would seem to skyrocket into the pay as you ride payment method.
